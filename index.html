        <h2>What is global warming, explained</h2>


        <h3>The planet is heating up—and fast.</h3> <br><br>

        <p>

            Glaciers are melting, sea levels are rising, cloud forests are dying, and wildlife is scrambling to keep
            pace. It has become clear that humans have caused most of the past century's warming by releasing
            heat-trapping gases as we power our modern lives. Called greenhouse gases, their levels are higher now than
            at any time in the last 800,000 years. <br><br>

            We often call the result global warming, but it is causing a set of changes to the Earth's climate, or
            long-term weather patterns, that varies from place to place. While many people think of global warming and
            climate change as synonyms, scientists use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting
            our planet’s weather and climate systems—in part because some areas actually get cooler in the short term.
            <br><br>

            Climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also extreme weather events, shifting
            wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts. All of those changes are
            emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, changing the rhythms of
            climate that all living things have come to rely on.<br><br>

            What will we do—what can we do—to slow this human-caused warming? How will we cope with the changes we've
            already set into motion? While we struggle to figure it all out, the fate of the Earth as we know it—coasts,
            forests, farms, and snow-capped mountains—hangs in the balance.<br><br>

        </p>

        <h2>Understanding the greenhouse effect</h2>

        <p>


            The "greenhouse effect" is the warming that happ
            ens when certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap heat. These
            gases let in light but keep heat from escaping, like the glass walls of a greenhouse, hence the name.
            <br><br>

            Sunlight shines onto the Earth's surface, where the energy is absorbed and then radiate back into the
            atmosphere
            as heat. In the atmosphere, greenhouse gas molecules trap some of the heat, and the rest escapes into space.
            The
            more greenhouse gases concentrate in the atmosphere, the more heat gets locked up in the molecules.<br><br>

            Scientists have known about the greenhouse effect since 1824, when Joseph Fourier calculated that the Earth
            would be much colder if it had no atmosphere. This natural greenhouse effect is what keeps the Earth's
            climate
            livable. Without it, the Earth's surface would be an average of about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees
            Celsius)
            cooler.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>

            In 1895, the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius discovered that humans could enhance the greenhouse effect by
            making carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. He kicked off 100 years of climate research that has given us a
            sophisticated understanding of global warming. <br><br>

            Levels of greenhouse gases have gone up and down over the Earth's history, but they had been fairly constant
            for
            the past few thousand years. Global average temperatures had also stayed fairly constant over that
            time—until
            the past 150 years. Through the burning of fossil fuels and other activities that have emitted large amounts
            of
            greenhouse gases, particularly over the past few decades, humans are now enhancing the greenhouse effect and
            warming Earth significantly, and in ways that promise many effects, scientists warn. <br><br>
        </p>


        <h2>Aren't temperature changes natural?</h2>
        <br><br><br>

        <p>

            Human activity isn't the only factor that affects Earth's climate. Volcanic eruptions and variations in
            solar
            radiation from sunspots, solar wind, and the Earth's position relative to the sun also play a role. So do
            large-scale weather patterns such as El Niño.
